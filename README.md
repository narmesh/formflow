# FormFlow

> **Where Mathematics Shapes Organic Art**

FormFlow is a generative art web application that transforms mathematical equations into flowing, organic vector forms. Each generation creates unique, abstract shapes that feel alive — like something between a sea creature, a biological cell, or an alien sculpture — yet they're purely math-driven.

## 🌀 What is FormFlow?

FormFlow explores **organic beauty through computational design** — the harmony of chaos and form. It's a single-page application that generates deterministic, mathematically-driven organic shapes on demand. Think of it as a daily playground where geometry meets nature.

### Core Philosophy

- **Mathematical Foundation**: Every curve, every flow is generated from parametric equations, noise functions, and wave interference
- **Organic Aesthetics**: Despite being 100% algorithmic, forms feel natural and alive
- **Deterministic Creativity**: Same seed = same form, ensuring reproducibility
- **Infinite Variety**: Billions of unique combinations through advanced entropy systems

## 🧠 The Mathematics Behind FormFlow

### **Mulberry32 PRNG**

FormFlow uses the Mulberry32 pseudorandom number generator instead of basic `Math.random()`. This provides:

- **Determinism**: Same seed always produces identical results
- **High Entropy**: Uniform distribution across 4.3 billion possible seeds
- **Non-Repetition**: Eliminates pattern clustering from periodic functions

```javascript
random() {
  let t = this.seed += 0x6D2B79F5;
  t = Math.imul(t ^ t >>> 15, t | 1);
  t ^= t + Math.imul(t ^ t >>> 7, t | 61);
  return ((t ^ t >>> 14) >>> 0) / 4294967296;
}
```

### **Multi-Octave Simplex Noise**

Natural-looking organic detail comes from fractal noise:

```javascript
noiseOctaves(x, y, octaves = 4, falloff = 0.5) {
  let value = 0, amp = 1, freq = 1, maxValue = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < octaves; i++) {
    value += this.noise(x * freq, y * freq) * amp;
    maxValue += amp;
    freq *= 2;
    amp *= falloff;
  }
  return value / maxValue;
}
```

This creates detail at multiple scales — from large-scale shape to fine surface texture.

### **Parametric Form Generation**

Forms are generated using polar coordinates:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < numPoints; i++) {
  const angle = (i / numPoints) * Math.PI * 2;
  let r = baseRadius;
  
  // Layer mathematical transformations
  r += Math.sin(angle * symmetry) * amplitude;
  r += noise.noiseOctaves(cos(angle), sin(angle)) * intensity;
  
  // Convert to Cartesian
  points.push({
    x: centerX + Math.cos(angle) * r,
    y: centerY + Math.sin(angle) * r
  });
}
```

### **Safety Bounds**

All radius values are clamped to ensure visual coherence:

```javascript
r = Math.min(Math.max(r, 60), 280);
```

This prevents forms from collapsing to points or exploding beyond the canvas.

## 🧩 Algorithm Deep Dive

### **Radial Organic**

The most versatile algorithm, combining multiple sine/cosine waves with different frequencies:

```
r = baseRadius + Σ(sin(angle × symmetry × j) / j) + noise
```

Creates balanced, symmetrical forms reminiscent of flowers, snowflakes, or sea creatures.

### **Spiral Flow**

Expanding spirals with noise perturbation:

```
angle = t × spirals
r = base + t × expansion + noise(t, angle)
```

Generates forms that feel like they're rotating or flowing outward.

### **Cellular Blob**

Multiple "growth points" that influence nearby regions:

```
r = base + Σ(max(0, cos(angle - cellAngle)) × influence)
```

Mimics biological cell division and organic clustering.

### **Parametric Wave**

Classic Lissajous curves with noise:

```
r = scale × (sin(a×t) + cos(b×t)) + noise
```

Creates figure-eight patterns, loops, and harmonic shapes.

### **Fractal Branch**

Self-similar patterns at multiple scales:

```
r = base + Σ(sin(angle × branches × 2^(level-1)) / level)
```

Resembles tree branches, lightning, or neural networks.

### **Interference Pattern**

Multiple wave frequencies interfering:

```
r = base + Σ(sin(angle × w × 2) / w + cos(angle × (w+1)) / w)
```

Creates complex harmonic structures like ripples on water.

### **Geometric Morph**

Interpolates between circle and polygon:

```
r = circleR × (1-morph) + polygonR × morph + noise
```

Produces forms that balance geometric precision with organic flow.

### **Turbulent Field**

High-frequency multi-octave noise dominates:

```
r = base + noiseOctaves(5 layers) × turbulence
```

Creates chaotic, unpredictable shapes with rich texture.
